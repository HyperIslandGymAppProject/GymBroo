create policy "Profiles are viewable by users who created them."
on profiles for select
using ( auth.uid() = id );

Here's the chain of events for Profile:

You have a state: const [profile, setProfile] = useState(null);. This means profile starts off as null.
You have an effect that tries to fetch the profile from a database (or some remote source) based on session.user.id.
Until that effect completes and updates the profile state, profile remains null.
The UserContext.Provider uses the current value of profile (which is null initially) and provides it to all child components that use useContext(UserContext).
The PostFormCard component tries to consume this context and therefore receives profile as null.

Index.js
useEffect(() => {
if (!session || !session.user) {
//chatGPT explanation
return;
}
supabase
.from("profiles")
.select()
.eq("id", session.user.id)
.then((result) => {
if (result.data.length) {
setProfile(result.data[0]); //do not understand this I
}
});
}, [session]); //chatGPT explanation. Dawid: !session?.user?.id

THERE IS A SERIOUS BUG ==> Given the new context you provided, this seems like a potential problem with the sequence in which things are happening during the logout and login flow.

When you log out and then log back in, there's likely a slight delay between when the session is established and when the user profile is fetched. This can happen for several reasons:

1. **Asynchronous Operations**: The session might be established before the profile is fetched. Due to the asynchronous nature of JavaScript, fetching the profile might take slightly longer.

2. **Cache or Session Invalidation**: When logging out, any cache or session-related data might get invalidated or cleared. When you log back in, the app has to refetch the profile from the database, introducing a delay.

3. **Re-renders**: React components re-render whenever their state or props change. If the session is being set before the profile, it can cause the component to render with a valid session but an invalid (null) profile.

Here are steps to diagnose and potentially fix the issue:

1. **Sequential Fetching**: Ensure that the profile is only fetched once the session is completely established. You can nest asynchronous calls or use async/await to ensure that the profile fetch only happens after a valid session exists.

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  async function fetchProfile() {
    if (session?.user?.id) {
      const result = await supabase
        .from("profiles")
        .select()
        .eq("id", session.user.id);
      if (result.data.length) {
        setProfile(result.data[0]);
      }
    }
  }
  fetchProfile();
}, [session?.user?.id]);
```

2. **Session Change Handling**: Handle changes to the session more gracefully. When the session changes (like during logout and login), ensure that you also reset the profile state to its default value.

3. **Loading State**: Implement a loading state in your application. Show a spinner or a loading message until both the session and the profile are fully loaded. This way, the user doesn't interact with a half-loaded state.

4. **Error Handling**: Ensure you're handling any errors that might arise during the fetching of profiles. Maybe the error is happening but is being silently ignored.

5. **Component Logic**: Check the logic of other components or hooks involved in the logout and login flow. There might be something else that's triggering a re-render or causing the fetch operation to malfunction.

6. **Cache**: If you're using any form of cache, ensure that it is cleared appropriately during logout and is correctly utilized during login.

Lastly, debugging tools can be handy. Consider using tools like [React DevTools](https://reactjs.org/blog/2019/08/15/new-react-devtools.html) to inspect component states and hooks in real-time. This might give you more insights into what's happening during the logout and login flow.
